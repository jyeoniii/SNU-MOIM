## Project Abstract
This project aims to create service that can help SNU students to find other students to arrange some meeting for any purpose. It categorizes meetings into several categories (i.e. Study, a student club, performance) so that users can easily find the meetings they want. The two primary features of this project are creating a new meeting & participating in an existing meeting (which is already created by other users). Also, this service can recommend some meetings that the user might like based on user information. It can also connect to Facebook to get much information of the user.

## Features
- Various options for each categories
- User friendly interface
- Search function
- SNU Member Authentication (by SNU mail)
- Comment (Private / Public)
- Home interface

## Project Architecture
- Frontend : Angular2 + Typescript
- Backend : Django + Python
- Design : Bootstrap
